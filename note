incomplete list retrieved by comparision of names, 
not possible to have multiple tasks with same name under different categories(pending/complete)

a task done, will consider new added tasks complete if name matches

* del [] should delete all tasks with same name
* done - 

----------------------------------------
* don't add task if already present
* effect of done is not permanent

add function
* check if task in task.txt
    - present:
        - check if present in complete.txt
            - True: remove all occurances of task from complete
            - False: do nothing
    - absent: append to task.txt

issue: doesn't update priority of same task on add until it's deleted
